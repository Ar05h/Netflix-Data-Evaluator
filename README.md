# Netflix-Data-Evaluator
Netflix Data Evaluator is my first ever project. This project figures out how much time you have spent on movies or shows you have watched on Netflix. It also looks at the specific days and times by graphing two charts. This was created in Jupyter Notebook and I used Python and pandas.
